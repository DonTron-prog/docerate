Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share this custom-built static site generator that powers this blog. Built with Python and hosted on AWS S3, it combines simplicity with powerful features.

## Why Build a Custom Static Site Generator?

While there are many excellent static site generators available (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby), I wanted something that:

1. **Gives me complete control** over the layout and functionality
2. **Stays minimal and fast** - no JavaScript frameworks required
3. **Integrates perfectly** with my existing AWS infrastructure
4. **Supports all the features** I need for technical blogging

## Features

This static site generator includes everything needed for a modern blog:

### Markdown Support

Write posts in markdown with full support for:

- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- Tables for structured data
- Images with automatic optimization
- Task lists for project tracking
- Footnotes for additional context[^1]

### Code Highlighting

Here's an example of the Python code that converts markdown to HTML:

```python
def parse_markdown(content):
    """Convert markdown content to HTML with extensions."""
    md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=[
        'codehilite',
        'tables',
        'fenced_code',
        'footnotes',
        'toc'
    ])
    return md.convert(content)
```

### Table Support

The generator also supports GitHub-flavored markdown tables:

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Markdown parsing | Convert .md files to HTML | âœ… Complete |
| Syntax highlighting | Beautiful code blocks | âœ… Complete |
| Image optimization | Automatic thumbnail generation | âœ… Complete |
| Search | Client-side search with JSON index | âœ… Complete |
| RSS Feed | For feed readers | ðŸš§ Coming soon |

### Task Lists

Track project progress with task lists:

- [x] Set up Python project structure
- [x] Implement markdown parser
- [x] Create responsive templates
- [x] Add syntax highlighting
- [ ] Implement RSS feed
- [ ] Add sitemap generation

## Technical Implementation

The generator is built with just a few Python dependencies:

```python
# Core dependencies
markdown==3.5.1          # Markdown parsing
pymdown-extensions==10.5 # Extended markdown features
jinja2==3.1.2           # Template engine
pygments==2.17.2        # Syntax highlighting
pillow==10.2.0          # Image processing
```

### Build Process

The build process is straightforward:

1. **Parse markdown files** with YAML frontmatter
2. **Generate HTML** using Jinja2 templates
3. **Optimize images** and create thumbnails
4. **Build search index** as JSON
5. **Deploy to S3** via GitHub Actions

### Performance

The site is blazing fast:

- **Build time**: ~1 second for 100 posts
- **Page size**: <50KB including CSS
- **Time to interactive**: <500ms with CDN
- **Perfect Lighthouse score**: 100/100

## AWS Infrastructure

The blog runs on a simple but effective AWS setup:

```yaml
Infrastructure:
  Storage: S3 bucket with static hosting
  CDN: CloudFront for global distribution
  DNS: Route 53 for domain management
  Deployment: GitHub Actions CI/CD
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more features:

1. **RSS feed** for subscribers
2. **Dark mode** toggle
3. **Comments** via GitHub discussions
4. **Analytics** with privacy-friendly tracking
5. **Newsletter** integration

## Get the Code

The entire static site generator is open source. You can use it for your own blog or as inspiration for building your own tools. Check out the [GitHub repository](#) for installation instructions and documentation.

Thanks for reading! I'm excited to share more technical content, tutorials, and insights on this new platform. Stay tuned for posts about Python, AWS, web development, and more.

[^1]: Footnotes are great for adding additional context without cluttering the main text.
